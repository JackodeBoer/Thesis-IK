@MyleszIzzEree i could honestly cry, she has just shown how good she is by being so nice even though she came 2nd i am outraged 

Struggling....all day 

Susan Boyle came in 2nd  Diversity, a dance group won BGT.

Well, a complete travesty - Susan Boyle comes second to a group of layabouts from Basildon!!! Now I know why I don't watch these shows 

@aceweekly i didn't even know about the fair until i saw tweets going by about it. 

@the_macbean I wish the real world was as small as the internet world.
